To make it easier to visualize the catchments, one can randomize the labels of the grid with `shufflelabel`. Drainage basins are labeled with discrete indices, and it is often a good idea to use nearest-neighbor interpolation when visualizing a discrete `GridObject` to avoid smearing of the boundaries between drainage basins."
