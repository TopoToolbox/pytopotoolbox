    "TopoToolbox requires no preprocessing or hydrological conditioning before calling `FlowObject`. Don't fill sinks although there is a function available to do this (`fillsinks`). `FlowObject` will determine closed depressions and derive flow directions in these sinks so that flow paths run along the valley thalwegs as closely as possible. Filling the DEM before would discard the topographic information in topographic depressions that would otherwise constrain the flow paths.\n",

    "Catchments can be derived using the function `drainagebasins`. The function returns a `GridObject` with integer values (a label grid). To make it easier to visualize the catchments, one can randomize the labels of the grid with `shufflelabel`. Drainage basins are labeled with discrete indices, and it is often a good idea to use nearest-neighbor interpolation when visualizing a discrete `GridObject` to avoid smearing of the boundaries between drainage basins."
