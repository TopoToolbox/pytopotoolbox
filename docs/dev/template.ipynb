    "# Example notebook for TopoToolbox\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have used TopoToolbox to do something cool, we would love to feature your work on our [website](https://topotoolbox.github.io)! Creating an example for our gallery can be a great way to share your work with the TopoToolbox community and to get started contributing to the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using pytopotoolbox, the easiest way to do this is to create a Jupyter Notebook. This notebook shows you all the components you should have to successfully contribute an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Give your example a descriptive title (e.g. \"Example notebook for TopoToolbox\") as a top-level heading at the beginning of your notebook. The filename (e.g. \"template.ipynb\") must be unique among our example notebooks and should also be descriptive.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example notebook lives in the docs/dev folder, but you should put yours in [docs/examples](https://github.com/TopoToolbox/pytopotoolbox/tree/main/docs/examples). Add the filename for your example without the `.ipynb` extension to [docs/examples.rst](https://github.com/TopoToolbox/pytopotoolbox/blob/main/docs/examples.rst)` to have your notebook show up in our [Examples gallery](../examples.rst).\n",

    "Potential contributors to TopoToolbox\n",

    "It is a good idea to give a brief statement about who you think would get the most out of your example and what they might need to know to follow along. If you are sharing some educational materials that you have used in a course, for example, share the expected prerequisites of students in your course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Add an introduction to your example where you describe the problem you are trying to solve. Think about the audience that you listed above and target the level of description to those readers. Don't spend too much time describing your problem, though. This is meant to showcase your application of TopoToolbox. Get to the code sooner rather than later!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to import dependencies before running any code that requires those dependencies. Feel free to do so all at once at the beginning, as shown here, or only when you need particular functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to topotoolbox, users can be expected to have [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [scipy](https://scipy.org/) because TopoToolbox directly depends on those packages."

These are not installed by default when a user installs pytopotoolbox. Instead, they are installed when the notebooks are compiled into HTML on our continuous integration server. If the packages are not listed there, they will not be available during compilation and the build process will fail. Be judicious in what dependencies you add here. We will review them and may ask you to make changes to your code if you add too many dependencies or ones that are not essential to your example."
