    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Willett’s et al. (2014) paper on the growth and decay of drainage basins, chimaps have become a popular tool to illustrate the direction of divide migration. Whether a drainage basin is a victim or aggressor, i.e., will loose or gain catchment area in the future, is indicated by the variable chi in the vicinity of the divides. chi (Χ) is a transformed horizontal coordinate measured from the outlet of a drainage basin. The transformation uses upslope area to linearize the concave upward profile for a well-chosen value of the mn-ratio. If all drainage basin outlets have the same elevation, then chi values should be roughly the same on both sides of the divides in a steady-state situation. In this case, no drainage basin reorganization should be expected. Yet, if chi values differ, then one should expect that divides migrate from the basins with lower chi values (i.e. the aggressors) towards those with higher chi values (i.e. the victims) (see Figure below).\n",

The Mendocino region hosts the Mendocino Triple Junction where the Gorda plate, the North American plate, and the Pacific plate meet. The geometry of the plates and their movements have likely favored the development of a slab window and upwelling of astenospheric material, leading to differential patterns of uplift, seismic activity and extrusion of volcanic rock.\n",

The modify function is extremely versatile. Here we use its option ‘upstreamto’ that requires a GRIDobj of zeros and ones. The modify function will then modify the stream network so that it contains streams only upstream of regions with ones. We use the output of griddedcontour and modify it slightly using the function bwmorph to produce gridded contours that are [four-connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_connectivity#4-connected).

In its simplest form, the SPL shows that the energy expenditure required to incise into the stream bed is a function of stream gradient (S) and upslope area (A) and some parameters k, m and n.

    "Are these significant differences? Well, it seems by just looking at the range of values. However, to my knowledge no approach exists that provides a more objective way of evaluating the significance of contrasting chi values and their implications about rates of divide migration. Still, we now have a nice map that can aid our geomorphic assessment together with the tectonic and geodynamic interpretation of the Mendocino Triple Junction.\n",

    "Unfortunately, I must leave the discussion to you since I am quite unfamiliar with the region. If anyone wants to share his or her interpretation, I’d be more than happy to provide space here. So far, I hope that these few posts on chimaps were useful to you and sufficiently informative to enable you to compute chimaps by yourself. In my next post, I will give a short summary and show with another example that eventually chimaps can be derived really in a few lines of code."
