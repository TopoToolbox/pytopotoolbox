    # in the drainage basins array that has each label, `idxs`, and, for
    # each pixel, the index of its label in the label set, `invs`. If we
    # have B basins in an N x M DEM, `us` is a length B array of basin
    # labels, `idxs` is an length B array of pixel indices and `invs` is

    # column-major and row-major drainage basins. Below the "main array"
    # refers to the array whose pattern we are trying to reconstruct
    # and the "alternate array" is the one we reconstruct from.

    # First, we use the `idxs` of the alternate array to extract the
    # `invs` of the main array at each of the representative
    # pixels. Then we index into the `us` of the main array to find
    # the labels assigned to each of the representative pixels /in the
    # order in which they show up in the alternate `idxs` array/,
    # which is also the order of the labels in the alternate `us`
    # array. This array represents the bijection between the main
    # labels and the alternate labels. When we index into this length

    # that should be assigned to each pixel in the alternate array if
